RequestDispatcher
----------------------
	-> RequestDispatcher is an interface
	-> it allows to transfer a request from one resource to another 		resource (i.e. html, servlet, jsp etc)
	-> it is used to "include" the content of another resource or 		"forward" the request to another resource

	public void foward(req, res)
	
	public void include(req, res)

==> forward()
----------------------

	RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("urlofresource");
	rd.foward(request, response);


Session Management / State Management
---------------------------------------

	-> Session
		-> HTTP protocol and Web Servers are stateless. 
		-> for web server, every request is a new request
		-> the server can't identiy if the request is coming fom 			client that has been sending the request previously

		-> Session is a conversational state between client and 				server
		-> following are the ways for Session management

			a. cookies
			b. url re-rewriting
			c. html hidden field
			d. Session Management API

=> Session Management API
-------------------------------
	-> HttpSession interface provides Session Management 
	-> for every request Servlet Container creates a HttpSession Object 		which has a unique identifier

	     HttpSession  getSession()
			-> returns a HttpSession object associated 						with the request
		
             String getId()
			-> returns a string containing the unique identifier
